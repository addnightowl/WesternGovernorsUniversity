# D086 - Desktop Virtualization
<!-- 
PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Sparkit Company began by publishing books that teach English to middle and high school students. The company has increased in popularity throughout the years. They diversified their revenue stream by developing video games based on the characters from their novels. The Sparkit Company's Board of Directors desires that the company discover cost-cutting measures while continuing to promote its brand. The Board believes that by leveraging virtualization, the organization can uncover opportunities for innovation and productivity improvement. SC will expand its endeavor to the Windows and Linux systems, as well as hire additional technological professionals to make the company's gaming products available to new markets.

Sparkit Company's development team will have several operating systems on one workstation by developing a virtual environment for Quality Assurance testing. Furthermore, by eliminating the need to physically relocate and switch between workstations to test different features on different machines, existing and future IT personnel will be much more productive. Furthermore, by keeping each workstation build under the $800 budget, this environment will reduce hardware expenditures.
